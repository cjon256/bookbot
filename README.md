# bookbot
BookBot is not my first git project!

But it is my first when working through boot.dev

The site [boot.dev](https://boot.dev/) is a really fun environment for practicing coding. I'm working my way
through the Python series there (although I already know the language pretty well). Next is Javascript, which
is also pretty familiar. After that though they have a Go section, and that will be less of a refresher. I
know a little Go, but not enough to be dangerous. Hoping to change that.
